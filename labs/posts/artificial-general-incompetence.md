Hi Folks,

<br>

The faint beginnings of the proprietary site you see before you come at the end of an extremely long, tiring, and intense few weeks.


After an extensive process of arranging and organizing different data workflows / program changes, etc., I spun this site up early this morning for numerous reasons, one of which being in order to locally host reports going forward under a private subdomain.


While I came pretty close, and I'm pretty pleased at how quickly I was able to get this live and rolling, I'm not quite there yet.


Long story short, I have been swan diving into LLM fever, and I need a full round of sleep before I can put the energy into providing a full breakdown of the past few weeks.


That said, I think you'll both be relieved and pleased to hear the update. The dog is beginning to catch up to the rabbit. 


A bit more of your worn patience would be greatly appreciated, and I will give you a thorough State of the Union as soon as I'm not feeling too "goofy" to properly do so.
